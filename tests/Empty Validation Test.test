In addition, all models with the Infantry or Cavalry Unit Type and and the Character Unit Sub-type that have this special rule must select one Minor Arcana option ( See the Prosperine Arcana special rule). Any model with the Infantry or or Cavalry Unit Types and both the independent Character and Legiones astartes (Thousand Sons) special rule that does not already have one or more Psychic Disciplines may be upgraded for +15 additional points to gain a single Psychic Discipline from the Core Psychic Discipline list (see the Horus Heresy Age of Darkness rulebook, page 322).</description></rule></rules><profiles><profile id="cf3e-f5dc-292c-a3db" name="Thousand Sons Advanced Reaction" hidden="false" typeId="90b9-7fab-87db-aed3" typeName="Reactions"><characteristics><characteristic name="Description" typeId="c627-4637-8de5-65fb">This Advanced Reaction is available only to units composed entirely of models with both the Legiones Astartes (Thousand Sons) special rule and the Psyker Sub-type. Unlike Core Reactions, Advanced Reactions are activated in unique and specific circumstances, as noted in their descriptions, and can often have game changing effects. Advanced Reactions use up points of a Reactive player’s Reaction Allotment as normal and obey all other restrictions placed upon Reactions, unless it is specifically noted otherwise in their description.

Fortress of the Mind – This Advanced Reaction may be made once per battle during the opposing player’s Shooting phase when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a unit under the Reactive player’s control, made up entirely of models with the Legiones Astartes (Thousand Sons) special rule and the Psyker Sub-type. Once the Active player has resolved all To Hit and To Wound rolls, but before any Armour Saves are made, the Reactive player must make a Psychic check. If the Check is passed, the Reacting unit gains a 3+ Invulnerable Save against all Wounds inflicted as part of the Shooting Attack that triggered the Reaction. If the Check is failed then the Reacting unit gains only a 5+ Invulnerable Save and both the attacking unit and the reacting unit suffer Perils of the Warp, removing any casualties immediately before resolving any unsaved Wounds inflicted by the Shooting Attack that triggered this Reaction.</characteristic></characteristics></profile><profile id="d241-183c-06ad-80b2" name="Fortress of the Mind" hidden="false" typeId="90b9-7fab-87db-aed3" typeName="Reactions"><characteristics><characteristic name="Description" typeId="c627-4637-8de5-65fb">This Advanced Reaction may be made once per battle during the opposing player’s Shooting phase when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a unit under the Reactive player’s control, made up entirely of models with the Legiones Astartes (Thousand Sons) special rule and the Psyker Subtype.

A - On Mobile, after adding your initial detachment, press the + sign at the bottom left
B - On Desktop after adding your first force then just press add force again
Then choose the army you wish to have a lord of war from, then pick &quot;Lord of War Detachment&quot;. This allows the choice of any LoW from any army as per the rules of HH2 (apart from the new Ruinstorm Deamons one can only be taken in a Lord of War Detachment for Ruinstorm Daemons).
