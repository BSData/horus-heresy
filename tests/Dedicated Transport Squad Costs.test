Advanced Reactions use up points of a Reactive player’s Reaction Allotment as normal and obey all other restrictions placed upon Reactions, unless it is specifically noted otherwise in their description.

Fortress of the Mind – This Advanced Reaction may be made once per battle during the opposing player’s Shooting phase when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a unit under the Reactive player’s control, made up entirely of models with the Legiones Astartes (Thousand Sons) special rule and the Psyker Sub-type. Once the Active player has resolved all To Hit and To Wound rolls, but before any Armour Saves are made, the Reactive player must make a Psychic check. If the Check is passed, the Reacting unit gains a 3+ Invulnerable Save against all Wounds inflicted as part of the Shooting Attack that triggered the Reaction.

For each To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed, the target automatically suffers a Wound, regardless of its Toughness. The controlling player may choose to resolve these Wounds at AP 2 instead of the weapon’s normal AP value.
Similarly, if a model makes a Shooting Attack with a weapon that has the Rending special rule, a To Wound roll of equal to or greater than the listed value wounds automatically, regardless of Toughness, and is resolved at AP 2.
In either case, against Vehicles each Armour Penetration roll of equal to or greater than the listed value allows a further D3 to be rolled, with the result added to the total Strength of the attack. These Hits are not resolved at AP 2, but are instead resolved using the weapon’s AP value.
For example, a model with the Rending (5+) special rule that rolls To Wound against a non-Vehicle model will wound automatically on the roll of a 5+, and the attacking player has the choice of using an AP value of 2 instead of the AP value of their weapon.</description></rule><rule id="0325-11ef-9ba1-efd7" name="Achean Force" hidden="false" page="259"><description>The controlling player of any unit that includes one or more models with the Psyker Unit Sub-type and a weapon or ability with this special rule, may choose to activate this special rule before making any attacks with that weapon or resolving the ability.

Smoke launchers may only be used once per battle, and once triggered may not be further used – in addition, they do not count as a weapon and may not be targeted by Weapon Destroyed results on the Vehicle Damage table.</characteristic></characteristics></profile></profiles></selection></selections><costs><cost name="Pts" typeId="d2ee-04cb-5f8a-2642" value="35" /></costs><categories><category id="11f2-472f-c1d1-9ae9" name="Legiones Astartes" entryId="11f2-472f-c1d1-9ae9" primary="false" /><category id="e2b6-b770-784c-9e95" name="Vehicle:" entryId="e2b6-b770-784c-9e95" primary="false" /><category id="7b0a-a743-a8da-3a39" name="Transport Sub-type" entryId="7b0a-a743-a8da-3a39" primary="false" /></categories></selection><selection id="lt7mxx2951j1tvjjj4i" name="Legionaries (collective)" entryId="ffa9-f77a-058e-6c50::596b-7051-6378-ac8a" entryGroupId="ffa9-f77a-058e-6c50::097a-5712-c173-0477" number="4" type="model" from="group" group="0) Legionaries"><profiles><profile id="8bcd-d233-e477-f14c" name="Legionary" hidden="false" typeId="4bb2-cb95-e6c8-5a21" typeName="Unit"><characteristics><characteristic name="Unit Type" typeId="ddd7-6f5c-a939-b69e">Legionary (Infantry) (Psyker)</characteristic><characteristic name="Move" typeId="893e-2d76-8f04-44e5">7</characteristic><characteristic name="WS" typeId="cc42-7ed5-7092-5c84">4</characteristic><characteristic name="BS" typeId="74ae-c840-0036-d244">4</characteristic><characteristic name="S" typeId="e478-41d4-a092-48a8">4</characteristic><characteristic name="T" typeId="c32b-5fdd-3fbe-9b1f" /><characteristic name="W" typeId="57ee-1126-32a9-5672">1</characteristic><characteristic name="I" typeId="62d3-22d7-2d49-52dc">4</characteristic><characteristic name="A" typeId="f111-2ce5-dd12-d6b0">1</characteristic><characteristic name="Ld" typeId="e8a6-1da9-d384-8727">7</characteristic><characteristic name="Save" typeId="e593-6b3c-f169-04f0">3+</characteristic></characteristics></profile></profiles><selections><selection id="lt7mxx2yckzgs58qcml" name="Bolt Pistol" entryId="ffa9-f77a-058e-6c50::b4ce-7407-31e1-8c58::52fe-46cd-520d-9df3" entryGroupId="ffa9-f77a-058e-6c50::3f03-214c-5f07-a0c7" number="4" type="upgrade" from="group" group="1) Bolt Pistol Options"><profiles><profile id="8ace-30ed-d0c7-3b5b" name="Bolt Pistol" hidden="false" typeId="1a1a-e592-2849-a5c0" typeName="Weapon"><characteristics><characteristic name="Range" typeId="95ba-cda7-b831-6066">12&quot;</characteristic><characteristic name="Strength" typeId="24d9-b8e1-a355-2458">4</characteristic><characteristic name="AP" typeId="f7a6-e0d8-7973-cd8d">5</characteristic><characteristic name="Type" typeId="2f86-c8b4-b3b4-3ff9">Pistol 1</characteristic></characteristics></profile></profiles></selection></selections><costs><cost name="Pts" typeId="d2ee-04cb-5f8a-2642" value="48" /></costs></selection></selections><costs><cost name="Pts" typeId="d2ee-04cb-5f8a-2642" value="37" /></costs><categories><category id="8b4f-bfe2-ce7b-f1b1" name="Infantry:" entryId="8b4f-bfe2-ce7b-f1b1" primary="false" /><category id="11f2-472f-c1d1-9ae9" name="Legiones Astartes" entryId="11f2-472f-c1d1-9ae9" primary="false" /><category id="36c3-e85e-97cc-c503" name="Unit:" entryId="36c3-e85e-97cc-c503" primary="false" /><category id="9b5d-fac7-799b-d7e7" entryId="9b5d-fac7-799b-d7e7" name="Troops:" primary="true" /></categories></selection><selection id="lt7jnwcsxxr48sqzud9" name="Lords of War Have Moved to &quot;Lords of War Detachment&quot;" entryId="7d8-ddbf-ce7b-78f9" number="1" type="upgrade" from="entry"><rules><rule id="b1e1-9f1d-7934-c233" name="LoW (where are they?) THIS ENTRY CAN BE REMOVED FROM YOUR ROSTER WITHOUT ISSUE" hidden="false"><description>To add Lords of War you now need to add the additional detachment to your list. To do this:

A - On Mobile, after adding your initial detachment, press the + sign at the bottom left
B - On Desktop after adding your first force then just press add force again
Then choose the army you wish to have a lord of war from, then pick &quot;Lord of War Detachment&quot;. This allows the choice of any LoW from any army as per the rules of HH2 (apart from the new Ruinstorm Deamons one can only be taken in a Lord of War Detachment for Ruinstorm Daemons).
