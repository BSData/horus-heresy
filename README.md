## Important

__BattleScribe v1.15 users Notice__: _However we don't support BattleScribe v1.15 any longer, all the files in their last revisions for that BattleScribe are available [here](https://github.com/BSData/horus-heresy/releases/tag/6.9.3). Downloading `.bsr` file(one of the Downloads) and importing it in BattleScribe v1.15 will allow you to use these no-longer-maintained datafiles._
