## Overview ##

__What's this?__

This is the data repo for the Horus Heresy.

BSData organisation created this project. It's a GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe or any other company/publisher. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [our homepage][BSData.net]

We strongly recommend you use NewRecruit over Battlescribe, as battlescribe is abandonware.


__I found a bug!__ / *I have another request*

Great, thank you! Please [Report a bug][bug report] - you can also suggest enhancements and raise other issues there.

### Where did Horus Heresy 1.0 go?
We moved it to [its own repo](https://github.com/BSData/horus-heresy-1e). It is no longer maintained.

## Standards


### Creating units
#### Names
In general, we remove the "Legion" prefix from units, unless that unit has a non-legion equivalent such as Legion Baneblade

We create a unit entry for each unit, and a model entry within that unit (even if it's a single model unit).
This allows us to get an accurate model count and keeps everything consistent.

On UNITS we default them to hidden and add a modifier with constraint to set "Hidden to False" if "Equal to 1 selection in force of <> on". Ensure "And all child selections is checked".
On UPGRADES, we default the option to not hidden, and set "Hidden to True" if the "off" condition is selected.

#### Important reminders:
These are requirements on a unit to maintain rites of war:
- Solar Auxillia and Imperialis Militia units need "SA or IM Unit" for rites of war that count that number of units.
- - Lords of war should be excluded from this as they won't be in the "allied detachment"

### .cattemplate? and what are all the template_id_ comments?
A .cattemplate file is a .cat file, renamed to .cattemplate, used by [BSCOPY](https://github.com/nstephenh/BSCopy)

We used bscopy to copy all 18 legions after implementing the first one. 
We didn't maintain the template so it's not recommended to re-run bscopy
